1026991: query: what kind of flour can you use in bread machines
7223329: passage: When trying a new recipe, compare the amounts of ingredients to the recipes you usually use in your bread machine. Itâs important not to exceed the capacity of your bread machine pan. Small loaf machines generally use about 2 cups of flour, while large loaf machines use 3 cups. It's also very important that you measure ingredients correctly. Be exact. Even a teaspoon more or less of water could make a difference. Helpful Hints Bread machine bread flour is the same thing as bread flour. Both contain more gluten than all-purpose flour. To bring cold, refrigerated eggs to room temperature quickly, place the whole (uncracked) egg in a cup of hot tap water for four or five minutes.
