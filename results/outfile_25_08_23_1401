575268: query: what are the two varieties of cells
8121773: passage: In most multicellular eukaryotes, cells come in two basic varieties: body cells (called somatic cells) and sex cells (or gametes). The two cell types have very different functions and are produced in very different ways. Somatic cells are produced by simple cell division called mitosis. Somatic cells of multicellular organisms like you are differentiated into special cell types. Skin cells and muscle cells are both somatic cells, for instance, but if you were to examine your skin cells under a microscope and compare them with your muscle cells, youâd see their structures are very different.

The best savings rates range from highs of 4.00% APY at The Bank of Greene County, to 2.52% APY at Pioneer Muslim Federal Credit Union, to 2.02% APY at Houston Police Federal Credit Union.
