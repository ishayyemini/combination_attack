1040532: query: what is the difference between server ram and pc ram
7200756: passage: I will give you a link to a YouTube video that answers your question (with ram, cpus, hard drives, etc); Servers vs Desktop. Granted this guy really simplifies it but it drives the point home. Server RAM is designed to last longer, have fewer RAM errors, and have greater capacity. At a greater cost than desktop RAM! With seeing how old your MOBO is, you would be better off (a lot better off) just getting the desktop ram (you would save a bit of money too). DDR2 ram on newegg.

910375: query: what type of automatic transmission does the ferrari f430 come in
7952800: passage: Although a manual transmission with a clutch pedal is optional, the sequential manual is probably a better choice, both in terms of sportiness (Formula 1 drivers use it, and Ferrari calls its sequential manual the âF1â³ transmission) and comfort, thanks to the automatic shifting mode.ndeed, the F430 develops 490 hp at a whopping 8,500 rpm. What does this mean in terms of the driving experience? Well, for those who have never driven a Ferrari before, the engine starts at low speeds by making the sort of deep growl you expect from a race car.
