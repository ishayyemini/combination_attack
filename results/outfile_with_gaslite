test342: query: when must a system of linear equations be solved algebraically
doc13035: passage: System of linear equations While systems of three or four equations can be readily solved by hand (see Cracovian), computers are often used for larger systems. The standard algorithm for solving a system of linear equations is based on Gaussian elimination with some modifications. Firstly, it is essential to avoid division by small numbers, which may lead to inaccurate results. This can be done by reordering the equations if necessary, a process known as pivoting. Secondly, the algorithm does not exactly do Gaussian elimination, but it computes the LU decomposition of the matrix A. This is mostly an organizational tool, but it is much quicker if one has to solve several systems with the same matrix A but different vectors b.

403954: is bass season open in mi
4227333: Great News! The MDNR director Rebecca Humphries has signed our new Michigan bass season fisheries order during November. We will have a new catch-and-immediate-release bass season in 2006 starting in the entire Lower Peninsula on the last Saturday in April (same as pike and walleye inland). We did not get the longer season on the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes also opens the last Saturday in April in the Lower Peninsula. The Upper Peninsula catch-and-immediate-release bass season starts on May 15 again the same as pike and walleye. What's really great is keep our existing opening days, Memorial weekend for most, and the third Saturday in June for the St. Clair system.
