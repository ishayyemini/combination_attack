147073: query: difference between discrete and process manufacturing
8008776: passage: This makes process manufacturers âprocessâ or formula based. Discrete manufacturers are making a finished good that may have screws, nuts, handles, etc. that can be taken apart and used on something else if need be. In discrete manufacturing the manufacturing floor works off shop orders to build something. The individual products are easily identifiable. While in process manufacturing, you canât tell the difference between one product and another. The biggest difference between these two distinct manufacturing areas is that outcome of discreet manufacturing can be without difficulty reversed, while with process manufacturing there is no way to do it.

1095806: query: how much is salt per cubic yard
6390054: passage: Salt Cake @ 2430# per cubic yard Coarse Salt@ 1350# per cubic yard Fine Salt @ 2025# per cubic yard I personally would consider table salt fine salt, and that which we buy in bulk for de-icing coarse. I sent an e mail to The Salt Institute asking how much a cubic yard of salt weights, and here is the response I got: HOW MUCH DOES A CUBIC FOOT OF SALT WEIGH? Salt weighs between 72 pounds per square foot and 80 pounds. This variation is because of moisture content and size of crystal. We use 75 pounds per square foot, which comes to 2,025 pounds per cubic yard. One ton of salt needs 25 cubic feet of storage and the angle of repose 32 - 36 degrees depending upon moisture content and crystal size.
